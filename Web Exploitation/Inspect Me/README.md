## Challenge
> Inpect this code! `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53213` ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53213))
### Hint

> -   How do you inspect a website's code on a browser?
>-   Check all the website code.
## Solution

Let's open the link we got, looks like a normal site.
So let's dig in it, right click and choose view source page (Ctrl + U).
Immediately we can see a part of the flag in a comment:

>I learned HTML! Here's part 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe

let's search for the other 3 parts, in the top of the source we can see
that there is a java script file and css file, click on them (or add there name to the URL).
We now again can find the read the other 2 parts we searched for.
In the css file:

> I learned CSS! Here's part 2/3 of the flag: ct0r_g4dget_402b0bd3}

in the js file:

> I learned JavaScript! Here's part 3/3 of the flag:

so the third part is nothing...
